>"I was three, sitting alone, humming a Russian children’s song to myself. In translation:

>Little finch, little finch, where have you been?

>—Down at the market, drinking vodka.

>Hearing this performance, a visiting grown-up asked, did I know what vodka was? Now, the Russian for water is Vadá, and Vodka is its diminutive. So, being asked about vodka, I replied, “Eto málinkaya Vadá”—“it’s small water.” I confess to this story, because it signals an early tendency to address the signifier instead of the signified."

—Leo Steinberg, *False Starts, Loose Ends*
