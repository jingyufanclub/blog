title: Best Custom Piñatas in New York
---
A brief diversion: I'm delighted to announce that a pair of my custom piñatas are included in the Spring 2017 Real Weddings issue of Martha Stewart Weddings! The feature, [A Colorful Brooklyn Wedding with Lots of Patterns](http://www.marthastewartweddings.com/612755/colorful-patterned-brooklyn-wedding-samm-blake#612386), may be viewed online and my work is shown in slides 12 and 13.

You probably did not know that New York Magazine selected my work for ["Best Custom Piñatas"](http://nymag.com/weddings/planner/2015/winter/all-custom-everything/) in their Winter 2015 Weddings issue. Isn't that something.

If you'd like to see my other work, I have an installation of textiles, prints, and ceramics in The Wassaic Project's 2017 Summer Exhibition  [Vagabond Time Killers](http://wassaicproject.org/programming/exhibitions/upcoming/summer-2017-vagabond-time-killers/) on view from May 20 to September 23.
