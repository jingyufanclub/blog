title: Skip It
---
I'd like to talk about an exciting CSS discovery I made this week: `text-decoration-skip: ink`. This [property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-skip) specifies where a text decoration should break. In the case of `ink` this means that the underline will skip and leave white space around descenders, the portion of a character that extends below the baseline of the font. Though this property is reported by MDN, it is not yet supported by Firefox. If you are using Chrome or Safari desktop, you can see this effect by hovering over a link on this page. It's a minor change that improves the legibility of underlined text.
