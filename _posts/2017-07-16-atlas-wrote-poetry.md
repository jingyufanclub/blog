title: Atlas Wrote Poetry
---
I just read this terrific [article](https://blog.hrc.utexas.edu/2017/06/28/the-computer-poetry-of-j-m-coetzees-early-programming-career/) about the early computer programming career of the writer J. M. Coetzee. In the mid-1960s he had a hand in designing the Atlas 2 supercomputer in Britain. During off hours, he wrote programs to generate "computer poetry" using an algorithm to select and combine words from a closed vocabulary. The Harry Ransom Center at 	
The University of Texas at Austin has a [collection](http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00717) of Coetzee's papers that includes sheaves of this "computer poetry" on [dot matrix printouts](https://blog.hrc.utexas.edu/files/2017/06/MSS_CoetzeeJM_osb_143_001.jpg) from 1965. These papers were never published, but he did included some edited phrases in later writings. The archives also contain printouts of Coetzee's Fortran programs and Fortran pseudocode.
