title: A Variety of Hats to Put on Your Cat
---
Last week I worked with the GreenSock Animation Platform to make a little animation with a car in it. To research movement, I watched a lot of Pepé le Pew videos on YouTube followed by a viewing of _Space Jam_. Among other things I used GSAP to handle CSS property transformations, SVG objects, and easing in and out of transitions with different Bézier curves. After that I discovered the GSAP Draggable plugin that makes any DOM element draggable and spinnable. So of course I used it to make a game to put different headgear on my cat, Rufus. I made the layout with CSS grid and I didn't write any feature queries so the site is best seen on the latest version of any browser. Here are the [link](http://jingyufanclub.co/dunce-caps-for-cats) and [repo](https://github.com/jingyufanclub/dunce-caps-for-cats).

I think it's one of my best artworks to date; I am very pleased.
