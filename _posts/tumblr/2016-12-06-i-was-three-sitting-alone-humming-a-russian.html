<blockquote><p>I was three, sitting alone, humming a Russian children’s song to myself. In translation:</p>

<p><br/>
Little finch, little finch, where have you been?<br/>
—Down at the market, drinking vodka.</p>

<p><br/>
Hearing this performance, a visiting grown-up asked, did I know what vodka was? Now, the Russian for water is Vadá, and Vodka is its diminutive. So, being asked about vodka, I replied, “Eto málinkaya Vadá”—“it’s small water.” I confess to this story, because it signals an early tendency to address the signifier instead of the signified.</p></blockquote>&#8212;<p>Leo Steinberg, <i>False Starts, Loose Ends</i></p><p>I’m interested in the relationship between the semiotics of programming language and natural language, although I don’t have a cogent arguement right now.<br/></p>
