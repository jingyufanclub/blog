title: Something Different

The Sixth Annual Sandwich Summit will take place on September 23, 2017, and this year I am honored to be serving on the planning committee.

>The annual Sandwich Club Summit is a chance for fellow sandwich enthusiasts to come together and discuss pressing topics. The summit will include presentations, panels, workshops, a sandwich-themed exhibition and a grilled cheese bar. This year’s summit theme is “Something Different” and will focus on sides (chips, pickles, slaws, baked beans, beverage pairings, etc).
>—[Sandwich Club](http://sandwich-club.org/2017-sandwich-club-summit/)

We are currently accepting proposals for [presentations, workshop, or demos](https://goo.gl/forms/TPDNyoYI4AnHSbcn2) and [Upper Crust](https://goo.gl/forms/7PCK7igTdjFn3Wgr1), the official publication of Sandwich Summit. Proposals may entail anything concretely or marginally related to sandwiches and their accoutrements. The open call closes on June 15th.

My collaborator Ashley Robinson and I shall demo Sando Club, an app to help you find a friend with whom to share a sandwich lunch. I'd mentioned a [sandwich app](http://jingyufanclub.co/blog/sandwiches-in-the-expanded-field-or-happiness/) on this blog before, but this is a different product that I will discuss in future posts. We are very excited for its debut and hope you can join us at the Summit!
