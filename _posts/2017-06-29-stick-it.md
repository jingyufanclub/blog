title: Stick It
---
Continuing with neat CSS properties that also align with my naming scheme, I'd like to discuss `position: sticky`. Recently I worked on a layout for a site where I wanted to have a menu bar that would move with the page upon scroll and remain fixed once it hits the top. One can do this with JavaScript, but `sticky` takes care of it with just a couple of lines.
```css
#menu {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
```
The element is treated as relatively positioned until it reaches a specific threshold, here when the menu hits the very top of the container, at which point its position becomes fixed. Safari requires `position: -webkit-sticky` and support for Edge is in development.
