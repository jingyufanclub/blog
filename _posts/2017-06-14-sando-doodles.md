title: Sando Doodles

I have been noodling around with some [graphics and design ideas](http://jingyufanclub.co/sando-doodles/) for Sando Club app. I used the [GreenSock Animation Platform](https://greensock.com/) to animate DOM elements with JavaScript. [Previously](http://jingyufanclub.co/blog/a-variety-of-hats/), I worked with the GSAP [Draggable](https://greensock.com/draggable)  plugin to create [duncecapsforcats.com](http://duncecapsforcats.com/) and here I'm using their [TweenMax](https://greensock.com/tweenmax) package. Most of my animations are built by transforming CSS values such as by rotation or scale. GSAP facilitates that and gives several easing options that make the animations smooth and interesting. They have a handy  [visualizer](https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer)
but i find i watch some cartoons and play around with values and durations.
